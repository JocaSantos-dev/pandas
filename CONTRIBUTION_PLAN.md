## 4. Making a Contribution
 
- **Open Issue Chosen:**  
  [ENH: the error behaviour in pandas operation should be consistent – rename errors are ignore by default whereas drop errors are raise #61687](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/61687)
 
- **Issue Summary:**  
  In pandas, operations like `rename` silently ignore missing labels by default (unless `errors='raise'`), but operations like `drop` will raise an error for missing labels. This inconsistency in error-handling behavior is confusing. The feature request suggests making error behavior consistent across pandas APIs.
 
### Steps to Resolve the Issue:
1. Clarify API behavior by reviewing pandas functions (`rename`, `drop`, etc.) and documenting their default `errors` behavior.
2. Decide on a consistent default approach—either always ignore or always raise—ideally matching common use cases or enhancing explicitness.
3. Implement the change consistently:
   - Modify default parameters or error-checking logic in `DataFrame.rename()`, `Series.rename()`, `drop()`, `set_index()`, etc.
4. Update documentation in both docstrings and user guides to reflect the standardized behavior.
5. Add unit tests in files like `pandas/tests/frame/test_rename_drop_errors.py`, covering:
   - Missing labels with default behavior.
   - Explicit use of `errors='ignore'` and `errors='raise'`.
6. Validate changes by running `pytest pandas/tests/` and the full test suite.

### Example PR Title:
```
ENH: Standardize default errors behavior across rename and drop (#61687)
```
 
---
 
### PR Description:
```
This PR addresses [#61687](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/61687), which highlights an inconsistency in pandas default error handling: `rename()` silently ignores missing labels unless `errors='raise'` is specified, while methods like `drop()` raise errors for missing labels by default.
 
### Changes:
- Updated DataFrame/Series `rename()` to default to `errors='raise'` for consistency.
- Updated documentation and docstrings to reflect this change.
- Added unit tests to validate both default and explicit `errors` behavior for `rename` and `drop`.
 
### Rationale:
This enhances API consistency and helps avoid silent failures, making pandas operations more reliable.
 
### Testing:
- Tests covering missing-label scenarios with default/explicit `errors`.
- Run:
  ```bash
  pytest pandas/tests/frame/test_rename_drop_errors.py
  ```
  Plus full suite with:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```
```

### Testing the Fix
 
- Run scoped tests:
  ```bash
  pytest pandas/tests/frame/test_rename_drop_errors.py
  ```
 
- Run full test suite:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```
 
- Confirm that default errors behavior is consistent and that explicit usage of `errors='ignore'/'raise'` works correctly.
